        "The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations based on user inputs. The system integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a Large Language Model (LLM), LangChain, and a vector database to enhance the recommendation process.\n",

The stories movies tell have a value beyond making us\\nlaugh or cry or hold our breath in suspense. They provide clues to\\nunderstanding who we are... or were. Movies mirror our hopes and\\nfears, our achievements and failures. Like a painting, a symphony or a\\nnovel, movies an important source of artistic and cultural information\\nabout our country.\\nMovies matter, also, because they can be great teachers. Think\\nabout it. How does a young artist learn to paint or sculpt? By studying\\nthe works of the great masters. Likewise, musicians might study\\nBeethoven or the Beatles. To learn their craft and seek inspiration,\\nyoung writers may read Shakespeare, Austin, or even Harry Potter's\\ncreator, J. K. Rowling.\\nBut, if the great films of the past are lost (as many already are)\\nwho will the young filmmakers of tomorrow study?\\nBecause movies matter, the United States Congress passed in\\n1998 the National Film Preservation Act. Preservation means to\\nprotect films from deterioration as well as to restore decaying film\\nbefore images and sounds are lost forever.\\nBecause movies matter, some of the most famous directors in the\\nfilm industry created The Film Foundation. The foundation's goal is to\\nincrease awareness of this country's film heritage and to preserve as\\nmany films as we can. The first step in saving movies is understanding\\nthat movies are more than entertainment.\\nThe Film Foundation created this manual for you. We created\\nthis manual because we believe:\\n\\u25a0 viewing and/or making movies can be an exciting and\\ncreative learning experience for all youth;\\n\\u25a0 understanding the decisions, hard work, and passion\\nrequired to make a movie will help you better understand\\nwhy films are worth saving.\\nGet ready. The pages inside this manual are filled with all\\nkinds of creative activities. Some will challenge your critical thinking\\nskills. Some will inspire you to communicate with others as you\\nnever have before using images and sound as well as words.\\nWhether a movie-goer or a future filmmaker, you can be sure that\\nthe movies that matter to you, matter to us all.\\n | 3 |\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The stories movies tell have a value beyond making us\\nlaugh or cry or hold our breath in suspense. They provide clues to\\nunderstanding who we are... or were. Movies mirror our hopes and\\nfears, our achievements and failures. Like a painting, a symphony or a\\nnovel, movies an important source of artistic and cultural information\\nabout our country.\\nMovies matter, also, because they can be great teachers. Think\\nabout it. How does a young artist learn to paint or sculpt? By studying\\nthe works of the great masters. Likewise, musicians might study\\nBeethoven or the Beatles. To learn their craft and seek inspiration,\\nyoung writers may read Shakespeare, Austin, or even Harry Potter's\\ncreator, J. K. Rowling.\\nBut, if the great films of the past are lost (as many already are)\\nwho will the young filmmakers of tomorrow study?\\nBecause movies matter, the United States Congress passed in\\n1998 the National Film Preservation Act. Preservation means to\\nprotect films from deterioration as well as to restore decaying film\\nbefore images and sounds are lost forever.\\nBecause movies matter, some of the most famous directors in the\\nfilm industry created The Film Foundation. The foundation's goal is to\\nincrease awareness of this country's film heritage and to preserve as\\nmany films as we can. The first step in saving movies is understanding\\nthat movies are more than entertainment.\\nThe Film Foundation created this manual for you. We created\\nthis manual because we believe:\\n\\u25a0 viewing and/or making movies can be an exciting and\\ncreative learning experience for all youth;\\n\\u25a0 understanding the decisions, hard work, and passion\\nrequired to make a movie will help you better understand\\nwhy films are worth saving.\\nGet ready. The pages inside this manual are filled with all\\nkinds of creative activities. Some will challenge your critical thinking\\nskills. Some will inspire you to communicate with others as you\\nnever have before using images and sound as well as words.\\nWhether a movie-goer or a future filmmaker, you can be sure that\\nthe movies that matter to you, matter to us all.\\n | 3 |\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
