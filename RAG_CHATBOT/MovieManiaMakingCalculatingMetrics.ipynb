Paul Soady |\",\n          \" Movies matter because they are more than images and sounds.\\nThey are stories. The stories movies tell have a value beyond making us\\nlaugh or cry or hold our breath in suspense. They provide clues to\\nunderstanding who we are... or were. Movies mirror our hopes and\\nfears, our achievements and failures. Like a painting, a symphony or a\\nnovel, movies an important source of artistic and cultural information\\nabout our country.\\nMovies matter, also, because they can be great teachers. Think\\nabout it. How does a young artist learn to paint or sculpt? By studying\\nthe works of the great masters. Likewise, musicians might study\\nBeethoven or the Beatles. To learn their craft and seek inspiration,\\nyoung writers may read Shakespeare, Austin, or even Harry Potter's\\ncreator, J. K. Rowling.\\nBut, if the great films of the past are lost (as many already are)\\nwho will the young filmmakers of tomorrow study?\\nBecause movies matter, the United States Congress passed in\\n1998 the National Film Preservation Act. Preservation means to\\nprotect films from deterioration as well as to restore decaying film\\nbefore images and sounds are lost forever.\\nBecause movies matter, some of the most famous directors in the\\nfilm industry created The Film Foundation. The foundation's goal is to\\nincrease awareness of this country's film heritage and to preserve as\\nmany films as we can. The first step in saving movies is understanding\\nthat movies are more than entertainment.\\nThe Film Foundation created this manual for you. We created\\nthis manual because we believe:\\n\\u25a0 viewing and/or making movies can be an exciting and\\ncreative learning experience for all youth;\\n\\u25a0 understanding the decisions, hard work, and passion\\nrequired to make a movie will help you better understand\\nwhy films are worth saving.\\nGet ready. The pages inside this manual are filled with all\\nkinds of creative activities. Some will challenge your critical thinking\\nskills. Some will inspire you to communicate with others as you\\nnever have before using images and sound as well as words.\\nWhether a movie-goer or a future filmmaker, you can be sure that\\nthe movies that matter to you, matter to us all.\\n | 3 |\",\n          \" Introduction\\nThis manual will help you make a movie.\\nIt is written like a basic recipe for chocolate; it\\ngives you the basic ingredients and lays out the\\nprocess. Whether you make fudge or M & M's is\\nyour challenge. As a filmmaker, you also have a\\nchallenge: to tell your story with your vision,\\nusing your creativity and intelligence. Whether\\nyou are ambitiously learning how to make a\\nmovie on your own, or working with others in a\\nmoviemaking group or class, enjoy. Enjoy the\\nflexibility and discover the fantastic foibles of\\nfilmmaking.\\nThis guide explains the basics of making a\\nlow-budget, student film. It's a big contrast to\\nHollywood, but the talents and skills needed to\\nmake a good film are the same.\\nIn Hollywood, hundreds of people often\\nwork on a single film. You might work together\\nwith just eight friends but the process remains\\nthe same.\\nOn a big Hollywood production, there are\\nmany specific jobs. If you watch the credits at the\\nend of a major movie, you will see that there is a\\ndirector (who is in charge of the entire movie),\\nactors, at least one writer, a cinematographer, a\\nproducer, an executive producer, an associate\\nproducer, editors, art directors, and sound-effects\\npeople. One person operates the camera, one\\nperson is in charge of moving the camera, and\\nstill another might be in charge of making sure\\nnothing gets in the way of the camera. There are\\nalso dialogue coaches, stunt coordinators, grips\\nand gaffers, makeup artists, assistant makeup\\nartists, costume specialists, and assistant\\ncostume specialists. These are just a few of those\\ninvolved in a big Hollywood movie.\\nFortunately, you do not need all these\\npeople to make a film. In making a short film,\\neach person has a special role to play, and each\\nwill probably have multiple jobs in order to\\naccomplish all the aspects of film production.\\nThis guide introduces these different\\ncomponents.\\n\\u2022 Everyone has something special to offer\\nin making a movie.\\n\\u2022 This is about learning, having fun, and\\nexploring your creativity.\\nJust like athletes must practice to build\\ntheir strength, coordination and skill, this\\nmanual offers experiments, or explorations to\\nwork your moviemaking muscles. Some might\\nbe as boring as lifting weights. Others might be\\nas fun as a pick-up game of basketball. Together,\\nthey will help give you the skills and experiences\\nneeded to direct and make a movie. You have to\\nprovide the creativity.\\n | | |\\n| - | - |\\n| Photo: Ron Batzdorff | The Mask of Zorro |\\n|  | Copyright \\u00a91998 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. | \\n|  | All Rights Reserved. |\\n| Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas | The Grinch (Jim Carrey) conspires with his dog | \\n|  | Max to deprive the Who's of their favorite holiday. |\\n|  | Copyright \\u00a92001 Universal City Studios, Inc. | \\n|  | Courtesy of Universal Studios Publishing Rights, | \\n|  | a Division of Universal Studios Licensing, Inc. | \\n|  | All Rights Reserved. |\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Paul Soady |\",\n          \"Movies matter because they are more than images and sounds.\\nThey are stories. The stories movies tell have a value beyond making us\\nlaugh or cry or hold our breath in suspense. They provide clues to\\nunderstanding who we are... or were. Movies mirror our hopes and\\nfears, our achievements and failures. Like a painting, a symphony or a\\nnovel, movies an important source of artistic and cultural information\\nabout our country.\\nMovies matter, also, because they can be great teachers. Think\\nabout it. How does a young artist learn to paint or sculpt? By studying\\nthe works of the great masters. Likewise, musicians might study\\nBeethoven or the Beatles. To learn their craft and seek inspiration,\\nyoung writers may read Shakespeare, Austin, or even Harry Potter's\\ncreator, J. K. Rowling.\\nBut, if the great films of the past are lost (as many already are)\\nwho will the young filmmakers of tomorrow study?\\nBecause movies matter, the United States Congress passed in\\n1998 the National Film Preservation Act. Preservation means to\\nprotect films from deterioration as well as to restore decaying film\\nbefore images and sounds are lost forever.\\nBecause movies matter, some of the most famous directors in the\\nfilm industry created The Film Foundation. The foundation's goal is to\\nincrease awareness of this country's film heritage and to preserve as\\nmany films as we can. The first step in saving movies is understanding\\nthat movies are more than entertainment.\\nThe Film Foundation created this manual for you. We created\\nthis manual because we believe:\\n\\u25a0 viewing and/or making movies can be an exciting and\\ncreative learning experience for all youth;\\n\\u25a0 understanding the decisions, hard work, and passion\\nrequired to make a movie will help you better understand\\nwhy films are worth saving.\\nGet ready. The pages inside this manual are filled with all\\nkinds of creative activities. Some will challenge your critical thinking\\nskills. Some will inspire you to communicate with others as you\\nnever have before using images and sound as well as words.\\nWhether a movie-goer or a future filmmaker, you can be sure that\\nthe movies that matter to you, matter to us all.\\n | 3 |\",\n          \"Introduction\\nThis manual will help you make a movie.\\nIt is written like a basic recipe for chocolate; it\\ngives you the basic ingredients and lays out the\\nprocess. Whether you make fudge or M & M's is\\nyour challenge. As a filmmaker, you also have a\\nchallenge: to tell your story with your vision,\\nusing your creativity and intelligence. Whether\\nyou are ambitiously learning how to make a\\nmovie on your own, or working with others in a\\nmoviemaking group or class, enjoy. Enjoy the\\nflexibility and discover the fantastic foibles of\\nfilmmaking.\\nThis guide explains the basics of making a\\nlow-budget, student film. It's a big contrast to\\nHollywood, but the talents and skills needed to\\nmake a good film are the same.\\nIn Hollywood, hundreds of people often\\nwork on a single film. You might work together\\nwith just eight friends but the process remains\\nthe same.\\nOn a big Hollywood production, there are\\nmany specific jobs. If you watch the credits at the\\nend of a major movie, you will see that there is a\\ndirector (who is in charge of the entire movie),\\nactors, at least one writer, a cinematographer, a\\nproducer, an executive producer, an associate\\nproducer, editors, art directors, and sound-effects\\npeople. One person operates the camera, one\\nperson is in charge of moving the camera, and\\nstill another might be in charge of making sure\\nnothing gets in the way of the camera. There are\\nalso dialogue coaches, stunt coordinators, grips\\nand gaffers, makeup artists, assistant makeup\\nartists, costume specialists, and assistant\\ncostume specialists. These are just a few of those\\ninvolved in a big Hollywood movie.\\nFortunately, you do not need all these\\npeople to make a film. In making a short film,\\neach person has a special role to play, and each\\nwill probably have multiple jobs in order to\\naccomplish all the aspects of film production.\\nThis guide introduces these different\\ncomponents.\\n\\u2022 Everyone has something special to offer\\nin making a movie.\\n\\u2022 This is about learning, having fun, and\\nexploring your creativity.\\nJust like athletes must practice to build\\ntheir strength, coordination and skill, this\\nmanual offers experiments, or explorations to\\nwork your moviemaking muscles. Some might\\nbe as boring as lifting weights. Others might be\\nas fun as a pick-up game of basketball. Together,\\nthey will help give you the skills and experiences\\nneeded to direct and make a movie. You have to\\nprovide the creativity.\\n | | |\\n| - | - |\\n| Photo: Ron Batzdorff | The Mask of Zorro |\\n|  | Copyright \\u00a91998 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. | \\n|  | All Rights Reserved. |\\n| Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas | The Grinch (Jim Carrey) conspires with his dog | \\n|  | Max to deprive the Who's of their favorite holiday. |\\n|  | Copyright \\u00a92001 Universal City Studios, Inc. | \\n|  | Courtesy of Universal Studios Publishing Rights, | \\n|  | a Division of Universal Studios Licensing, Inc. | \\n|  | All Rights Reserved. |\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
